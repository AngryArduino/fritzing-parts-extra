# My Fritzing Parts
The aim of this project is to add extra parts to Fritzing.

# Current parts
Most parts are cheap modules from China for Arduino and Raspberry Pi. You can find them on Amazon.

The DS18B20 digital thermometer provides 9-bit to 12-bit Celsius temperature measurements and has an alarm function with nonvolatile user-programmable upper and lower trigger points. The DS18B20 communicates over a 1-Wire bus that by definition requires only one data line (and ground) for communication with a central microprocessor. In addition, the DS18B20 can derive power directly from the data line ("parasite power"), eliminating the need for an external power supply.

Each DS18B20 has a unique 64-bit serial code, which allows multiple DS18B20s to function on the same 1-Wire bus. Thus, it is simple to use one microprocessor to control many DS18B20s distributed over a large area. Applications that can benefit from this feature include HVAC environmental controls, temperature monitoring systems inside buildings, equipment, or machinery, and process monitoring and control systems.

NodeMCU (http://www.nodemcu.com/) is an open source IoT platform. It includes firmware (https://nodemcu-build.com/) which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems, and hardware which is based on the ESP-12E module. The term "NodeMCU" by default refers to the firmware rather than the dev kits. The firmware uses the Lua scripting language. It is based on the eLua project, and built on the Espressif Non-OS SDK for ESP8266. It uses many open source projects, such as lua-cjson, spiffs, etc. There is no official 3rd generation board. It turns out that v3 is a “version” invented by producer LoLin to signify minor improvements to the v2 boards. Among others they claim their USB port to be more robust and it’s using the reserved pins to supply 5V power from USB and another GND. The third boar is significantly larger than the v1 and v2 boards.
